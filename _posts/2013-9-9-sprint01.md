We will be using two-week sprints of development this fall as we complete our project. After each sprint, we will make a post with release notes and our plans for the next spring. With each sprint we hope to push an update to the alpha, beta, or prod channel of UBR on the Play Store. You can track our progress (or log bugs and feature requests) using the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/curtisullerich/butterflies/issues?state=open) over at Github.
