We overhauled GPS this sprint, implemented web export, and included a handy summary page for surveys to see the total specimens counted for each species.

##Sprint 06 Release Notes  
- Breadcrumbs happen at a very precise interval, instead of sporadically
- GPS automatically "warms up" when opening a non-begun survey (can turn this off in settings)
- Able to specify breadcrumbing period in seconds (as fast as 5 seconds)
- Able to specify breadcrumb and sighting location accuracy (high, medium, low)
- Survey summary page (through long-press on surveys in list)
- Automatic version/build date inclusion in about page
- Notification fixes
- Server upload! (for one survey at a time)
- Configurable transects

##Sprint 07 Plans
- Weather data collection
- Voucher photos
- Map overlays
