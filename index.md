Butterflies serve as a great [indicator species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_species) and their presence, migration patterns, and development are of interest to many researchers. There currently exist several disparate protocols used for collecting information about butterflies during surveys. Additionally, pencil-on-paper is currently the standard method of recording this data in the field. Working closely with ISU's Reiman Gardens, we aim to design and develop an Android and iOS app to efficiently collect this information and store it all in a central location for easy access and processing.  

If you would like to provide input to help the development of this app, feel free to fill out our [questionnaire](/questionnaire.html) or email us at <script type="text/javascript">
